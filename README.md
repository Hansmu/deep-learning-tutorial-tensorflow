Setting up:

Create the environment: *conda env create -f tfdl_env.yml*

Activate the environment with Anaconda: *conda activate tfdeeplearning*

In order to connect PyCharm with Juypter, run *jupyter notebook*, that will give a 
message saying:
> Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=blablabla

Copy that into PyCharm to connect it with Jupyter.
